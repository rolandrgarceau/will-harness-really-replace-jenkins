# Build New System Infrastructure 2020-04-07

After seeing a replace Jenkins scripts for continuous delivery with Harness, I put a pause on a couple repos to place my c_app test into a containerized deployment. Then coming across a few other alternatives with Kitware's products and Clang, I have to say the possibilities are endless. So this repo is documenting current options and running a hello world example with Harness.

For any solution: The less commands you need in the configure the better.

## How to follow this repo:

Sign up for an account [here](https://harness.io)

Try the get started. 

## Hello World

tl;dr

The get started was cryptic. It's another dryrun showcase. Logs dictate this. If the "created" resources actually get provisioned from all the "compatible" tooling, it would have had to pause and ask authentication questions. What does that really look like? Well I know I didn't put in my AWS account information for a IAM role, permissions to be modified, or allowed for ARN's to be built on my behalf. I will find my notes momentarily and get them posted here.
